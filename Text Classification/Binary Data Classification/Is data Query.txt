Description:

This repository contains code for classifying questions as either "Data Query" or "Not a Data Query" using a BERT-based neural network model. The model is trained on a dataset of questions and their corresponding labels, where a "Data Query" question refers to a query related to data analysis or retrieval.

Installations:

To run the code, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

!pip install pandas tensorflow tensorflow_text scikit-learn


Dependencies:

pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
tensorflow: Provides deep learning tools and frameworks.
tensorflow_text: Extends TensorFlow to support a variety of text processing tasks.
scikit-learn: Offers machine learning algorithms and tools for classification and evaluation.


Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using the provided command.
Run the provided Python script to train and evaluate the BERT-based model for question classification.
Code Overview:




The provided Python code performs the following tasks:

Data Preprocessing:

Splits the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Utilizes BERT preprocessing and encoding layers to generate sentence embeddings.

Model Training:

Constructs a neural network model using BERT layers for text encoding.
Compiles the model with appropriate loss function and evaluation metrics.
Trains the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluates the trained model on the testing data to assess its performance.
Computes classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Classification and Query Analysis:

Utilizes the trained model to classify new queries into "Data Query" or "Not a Data Query" categories.
Merges the classification results with the original dataset for further analysis.
