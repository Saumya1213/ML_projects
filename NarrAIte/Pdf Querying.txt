PDF Question Answering with MPNet Base v2 Embedding

This repository contains a simple PDF question answering (QA) model implemented using the MPNet Base v2 embedding, a vector database, Python as the programming language, and Gradio for the frontend interface.

Overview:

This project aims to create a user-friendly application for extracting answers to questions from PDF documents. The model utilizes MPNet Base v2, a powerful language model for generating embeddings from text data. These embeddings are then stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval during the question-answering process.

Key Components:

MPNet Base v2 Embedding:

The MPNet Base v2 model is used to generate embeddings from text data extracted from PDF documents. These embeddings capture semantic information about the text and are crucial for accurately answering questions.

Vector Database:

A vector database is employed to store the embeddings generated by the MPNet Base v2 model. This database allows for fast and efficient retrieval of embeddings based on similarity, enabling quick responses to user queries.
Python Implementation:

The project is implemented in Python, leveraging its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive libraries for natural language processing and web development.

Gradio Frontend:

Gradio is used to create an intuitive and interactive frontend interface for the QA model. Users can upload PDF documents, enter questions, and receive instant answers through the Gradio interface.
